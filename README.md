My name is Paula. I'm 36 years old.
I´m interested in becoming a Python Developer.
I have also practiced in online courses with **Platzi**, **Udemy** and websites like **Hackerrank**, **Solo Learn: Learn To Code**, **Codility** and **LeetCode**.
In addition, I´ve been studied with the program "Codo a Codo 4.0" the area of Backend Web Development using Python and Flask as tools.
I work in a full-time company in another field, but my wish is to find my place in the IT area.
Besides that, I’m studying English so I can improve it.
