Hi, my name is Paula. I am 34 years old.
I am learning Full Stack with Python.
I have also practiced in online courses with **Platzi**, **Udemy** and websites like **Hackerrank** and **Solo Learn: Learn To Code**.
I work in a full-time company in another field, but my wish is to become a Full Stack developer
